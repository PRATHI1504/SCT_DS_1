Salary Data Analysis: Visualising Salary Trends

This project explores the relationship between years of experience and salary using a histogram. The dataset contains two columns: YearsExperience and Salary. A histogram was created in Microsoft Excel to group salary ranges and visualise the frequency of salaries within these intervals.

The visualisation helps identify trends in salary distribution and offers insights into how salaries vary with experience. This task enhanced my understanding of data representation and the importance of visual tools in decision-making.

Tools used: Microsoft Excel.
Key takeaway: Histograms are a simple yet powerful way to analyse data patterns effectively.
